# Screensaver

A simple Python program to create a moving stars screensaver using the Pygame library.

## Introduction

This project is a Python implementation of a moving stars screensaver. The program creates a window displaying a field of stars that move in a pseudo-3D space. The stars' brightness changes as they move closer or farther away from the viewer, creating a visually appealing effect.

## Features

- Generates a field of stars with random positions and initial depth.
- Simulates stars moving in a pseudo-3D space towards the viewer.
- Adjusts the brightness of stars based on their depth to create a sense of depth perception.
